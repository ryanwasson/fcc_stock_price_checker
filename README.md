ISQA_5 - Nasdaq Stock Price Checker
===================================

### User Stories

1.  Set the content security policies to only allow loading of scripts and css from your server.
2.  I can **GET** `/api/stock-prices` with form data containing a Nasdaq *stock* ticker and recieve back an object *stockData*.
3.  In *stockData*, I can see the *stock*(string, the ticker), *price*(decimal in string format), and *likes*(int).
4.  I can also pass along field *like* as **true**(boolean) to have my like added to the stock(s). Only 1 like per ip should be accepted.
5.  If I pass along 2 stocks, the return object will be an array with both stock's info but instead of *likes*, it will display *rel_likes*(the difference between the likes on both) on both.
6.  A good way to receive current price is the following external API(replacing 'GOOG' with your stock): `https://finance.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ%3aGOOG`
7.  All 5 functional tests are complete and passing.

### Example usage:

`/api/stock-prices?stock=goog`\
`/api/stock-prices?stock=goog&like=true`\
`/api/stock-prices?stock=goog&stock=msft`\
`/api/stock-prices?stock=goog&stock=msft&like=true`

### Example return:

`{"stockData":{"stock":"GOOG","price":"786.90","likes":1}}`\
`{"stockData":[{"stock":"MSFT","price":"62.30","rel_likes":-1},{"stock":"GOOG","price":"786.90","rel_likes":1}]}`
